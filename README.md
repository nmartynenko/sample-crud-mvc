## Sample CRUD application [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nmartynenko/sample-crud-mvc.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nmartynenko/sample-crud-mvc)

This is sample Java application, which is represented as:

- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful server</a> on backend

- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">Single-page application</a> on frontend

### Applied technologies ###
Here is stack of Java-based technologies:

- [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) &mdash; embedded web-container;

- [Spring](http://www.springsource.org/) &mdash; IoC/DI/AOP container, as well as MVC-framework;

- [Spring Security](http://www.springsource.org/spring-security/) &mdash; ACL/security;

- [Spring Data JPA](http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/jpa) &mdash; JPA persistence;

- [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/) &mdash; JPA-vendor;

- [HyperSQL](http://hsqldb.org/) &mdash; embedded RDMBS;

- [OVal](http://oval.sourceforge.net/) &mdash; object validation (for me it's more preferable than [JSR-303](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=303));

- [Jackson](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) &mdash; Java JSON processor;

- [slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/) &mdash; Logger facade (with [log4j 2](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) adapter);

And things, which may be presented, but not be used.

Here is a stack of Javascript-based technologies:

- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) &mdash; main cross-browser framework;

- [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) &mdash; UI framework;

- [Datatables](http://datatables.net/) &mdash; jQuery-based tables plugin;

- [jQuery Validation plugin](http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/) &mdash; client-side form validation.

- [HandlebarsJS](http://handlebarsjs.com/) &mdash; [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/)-like template engine with pre-compilation;

- [GlobalizeJS](https://github.com/jquery/globalize) &mdash; client-side l10n and i18n;

- [JSON-js](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/) &mdash; fallback for those browsers, which don't support native ```JSON.parse``` and ```JSON.stringify``` functions.

### Download ###

### Getting started ###
You need to [download](#download) latest version of sources, unpack it and launch either ```start.sh``` on *nix systems or ```start.bat``` on windows platform.
After that you need to open in browser [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and enter following credentials:

- Admin credentials:
	- login: admin@example.com
	- pass:  admin

- User credentials:
	- login: user@example.com
	- pass:  user

The differences between them are in "write" abilities of Admin role.

__Note__: by default, DB is In-Memory only, therefore all changes will disappear after server's stopped.

### REST testing ###
In ```/etc``` folder of project there is [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/)-based sample of collaborating with REST-server in non-browser environment (for *nix and win platforms).

### Tested with ###
- [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) embedded
- [Jetty maven plugin](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/jetty-maven-plugin.html)
- Jetty standalone
- [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) embedded (6/7)
- Tomcat standalone

### Dependencies ###
For launching application you must to have installed:

- <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html">Java</a> with exposed ```JAVA_HOME``` env variable

- <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> with exposed ```mvn``` executable

- Internet connection (at least all necessary artifacts must be present)

### Known Issues ###
This application is for training purposes of technologies listed above.
The only issues may happen if there is wrong environment to launch the application.
